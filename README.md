<h2>Django Full Stack Web Application</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The application for requests/tickets/tasks management raised from the need of ecsaping from shared excel files where the risk of getting things messy is very very high. That affects the data quality which has enormous imapct on further reporting and the analysis.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Single django project can have multiple apps (separating blog section and store as both different apps within one web-site)</li>
 <li>Django possess the Object Relational Mapper (ORM) which allows to access database in obejct-oriented way.</li>
 <li>ORM allows to use different databases like SQLite or PostrgreSQL having no changes to code but accessing data with objects, f.e.:
  <br>
  - using SQLite db for development,<br>
  - using PostgreSQL db for production
 </li>
 <li>In ORM, we can represent database structure with classes - they are called MODELS.</li>
 <li>Once making migration with <b>python manage.py makemigrations</b>, djabgo converts a class into data schema.</li>
</ul>
